Snug Harbor Cultural Center

Address: 1000 Richmond Terr

Sitting just a ferry ride away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, this Staten Island gem, a former home for retired sailers, is still somewhat of a secret. Spread across 83 acres, the area boasts an enormous botanical garden and cultural center surrounded by cobblestone streets and tiny paths of Victorian and Tudor homes. One of the most popular attractions here is the Chinese Scholar¡¯s Garden, fitted with magnificent rocks meant to resemble mountains inspired by the poetry and paintings of Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist monks, as well as a bamboo forest path and Koi-filled pond.

Alor Caf¨¦

Address: 2110 Richmond Rd 
New York 

Deep in the quiet Staten Island enclave of Grant City you'll find Alor Caf¨¦. During brunch, the usually pulsating lounge foregoes the DJ in favor of flat screens playing cartoons. Grab a booth at an arched window and dig into the avocado breakfast burrito, sweet corn omelette or fried-egg-topped chicken schnitzel. Tear the kids away from the restaurant's stash of Wikki Stix by offering them a PB&J and banana sandwich.

Beso

Address: 11 Schuyler St 
Staten Island 
10301 
Though Beso is billed as a Spanish tapas bar, the menu at this sexy little spot goes far beyond Iberia (by way of Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico, for starters). What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in big flavors and conviviality. Grab a fruity-sweet glass of tequila-spiked sangria and go straight for the shrimp-and-calamari ceviche marinated in orange and lime juice, or the pan y cerdo with garlic-infused shredded pork with melted Mah¨®n cheese on crostini.

A tiki bar not far from the Fresh Kills Landfill may not always be the ideal spot to appreciate a sea breeze, but this irony-free place will help you forget that thought. Take a seat in a bamboo booth illuminated by a taxidermic blowfish lamp, and enjoy rum drinks served in coconuts or hula-girl glasses.

You could argue that the fact that the jewel in the crown of Staten Island hotels is a 3-star Hilton Garden Inn sets a fairly low bar for accommodation in New York¡¯s fifth borough. That said, this is a good one. Set within the 415 acres of preserved woodland of Staten Island's Corporate Park, this modern hotel is just a few minutes from Interstate 278. Each of its 198 guest rooms and suites features chic decor and is equipped with the signature Garden Sleep System, a TV, mini fridge, microwave and an ergonomic workstation with free wi-fi. Some suites even have whirlpool tubs. Lorenzo's Restaurant, Bar & Cabaret offers Italian and American cuisine along with live cabaret performances on select Fridays. Or, for the complete opposite experience, you could buy a meal from the 24-hour Pavilion Pantry and heat it in your in-room microwave. And for rooftop drinks, there¡¯s the Above Rooftop Lounge. What makes this hotel particularly pleasant is a large international and local art collection displayed in and around the hotel, along with landscaped gardens, including an outdoor Florentine Gazebo and views of the surrounding woodland. There¡¯s also an indoor pool and fitness center, and complimentary shuttles to Newark Airport and Staten Island Ferry.

Next door to the Garden Inn is sibling property Hampton Inn & Suites. As with the former, you know what to expect from the reputation of the chain, and what you get is straightforward, but decent.

This traditional West Shores Stable building has a rich equestrian theme. Each of its 107 rooms is equipped with a custom-designed bed, flat-screen TV, and free WiFi. There is also both a full desk and a lap desk for working on the bed (don¡¯t go falling asleep mid-report!). You also get a microwave, a mini fridge and a coffeemaker. In addition, the suites boast whirlpool tubs and/or pull-out sofas. There¡¯s a fitness center and indoor pool for working off the free hot breakfast they serve daily. And you can dine at neighboring Lorenzo¡¯s in the evening, which offers live cabaret acts at certain times.
