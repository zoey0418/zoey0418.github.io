Bronx Museum of the Arts

Address: 1040 Grand Concourse 
Bronx 
10456

Head to the Grand Concourse Cultural District for this exceptional modern institution. Though younger than many of the other museums in the city¡ªit was founded in 1971¡ªthe Bronx Museum¡¯s commitment to reflecting the rich, diverse cultures found in the borough through its permanent collection makes the museum a staple of New York. The art displayed there is mostly from modern and contemporary American artists, and special exhibits often try to tackle political and social problems relevant to today. If you don¡¯t have time for a full museum day, make sure you at least stop by the Bronx Museum Community Mural at Bronx Terminal Market, where an artist brought a scene from Bronx¡¯s natural landscape to a far more commercial spot in the borough.

Wave Hill, a glorious, scenic public garden, is tucked away in Riverdale, the northernmost region in the city. In the 19th and early 20th century, the giant estate and grounds were owned and rented by various notable people including bankers, conductors, imminent zoologists and Theodore Roosevelt¡¯s family. Today, head there to frolic along the hills and appreciate the manicured gardens, lovely architecture and staggering views of the Hudson River and the Palisades.

This Boogie Down saloon isn¡¯t just the best beer bar in the Bronx¡ªfor our money, it¡¯s unrivaled anywhere north of midtown. Uptowners have the bar¡¯s co-owner Chris Giudice to thank: In less than two years, the brick-walled joint has become a bona fide craft headquarters, hosting boisterous guest-brewer events, doling out growlers and attracting loyalists who attempt to sample and rate 100 different quaffs for the bar¡¯s Beer Club. And thanks to a lineup of 16 domestic-leaning taps, one rotating cask and more than 30 bottles, hitting the hundred mark isn¡¯t all that difficult.
