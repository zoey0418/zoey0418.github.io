Built in 1931 over the span of just 11 months, this 1,454-foot Art Deco skyscraper has long stood as symbol of American innovation and ambition, and was recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Looming large as ever in New York¡¯s skyline, the building is one of the most visited attractions in the city. With so many clamouring for the chance to take the 25-minute elevator ride to the open air observation deck on the 86th floor, it¡¯s best to arrive early, between 8am and noon, for a chance to take in those 360-degree views.

Central Park,New York, NY

https://media.timeout.com/images/101764639/750/422/image.jpg

As seen in numerous songs, books and movies, America¡¯s first landscaped public park is one of the most beloved attractions in New York City. Millions of tourists and locals alike seek year-round refuge from the concrete jungle within the idyllic, 843-acre plot, which was first brought to life in the mid-19th century by urban visionaries Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux. Their thoughtful design reflects a harmonious balance of scenic elements that lives on today: pastoral (the open, picnic-ready lawn of the Sheep Meadow), formal (the liner, tree-lined Mall) and picturesque (the densely wooded paths of the Ramble).

The Statue of Liberty

Address: Liberty Island 
New York 
10004 

Perhaps no other New York attraction is as iconic¡ªor as avoided by tourist-averse New Yorkers¡ªas Lady Liberty. Our tip: Dodge the foam-crown-sporting masses and skip the line for the ferry by prebooking a combo cruise-and-tour ticket (visit statuecruises.com for more information). A climb to the crown affords a panoramic view of New York Harbor and the chance to see the literal nuts and bolts of Fr¨¦d¨¦ric Auguste Bartholdi¡¯s creation. We also recommend stopping in the museum on Liberty Island, if only to marvel at the initial ambivalence of 19th-century New Yorkers when they were asked to fund the construction of the pedestal.

-restaurants

Katz¡¯s Delicatessen

https://media.timeout.com/images/101419569/750/422/image.jpg

Address: 205 E Houston St 
New York 
10002 

This cavernous cafeteria is a repository of New York history¡ªglossies of celebs spanning the past century crowd the walls, and the classic Jewish deli offerings are nonpareil. Start with a crisp-skinned, all-beef hot dog, then flag down a meat cutter and order a legendary sandwich. The brisket sings with horseradish, and the thick-cut pastrami stacked high between slices of rye is the stuff of dreams.

Peter Luger

Address: 178 Broadway 
Brooklyn 
11211 

https://media.timeout.com/images/105284100/750/422/image.jpg

Although a slew of Luger copycats have prospered in the last several years, none have captured the elusive charm of this beer-hall style eatery, with well-worn wooden floors and tables, and waiters in waist coats and bow ties. Excess is the thing, like the famous porterhouse for two, which is 44 ounces of sliced prime beef. Go for it all¡ªit¡¯s a singular New York experience that¡¯s worth having.

Lombardi¡¯s

Address: 32 Spring St 
New York

Gennario Lombardi opened his shop in Soho in 1905¡ªthe first pizzeria in the U.S. It¡¯s hard to vouch for how the pizzas tasted a century ago, but there¡¯s more elbow room now after a renovation, if not the charm of the old joint. Still, Lombardi¡¯s continues to bake a hot contender for best pie.

The Plaza hotel
Address: 768 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019

https://www.smartertravel.com/uploads/2018/03/The-Plaza.png

Before opening The Plaza in 1907, its designers curated a stunning collection of crystal chandeliers and gold-encrusted china in preparation for unveiling the grandest hotel in America. Numerous luminaries have crossed its opulent threshold, from presidents and politicians to royals, celebs, and Beatles. Ambitious moguls have made and lost fortunes here as glittering society waltzed in the Grand Ballroom, most famously for Truman Capote¡¯s legendary black and white ball.
The Plaza has also hosted fictional characters, from the Oak Room¡¯s starring role alongside Cary Grant in Hitchcock¡¯s classic thriller North By Northwest to Macaulay Culkin¡¯s lobby romp in Home Alone 2. But the best known may be a bright-eyed girl named Eloise, who came to life through a beloved book series. Guests can stay in a bright-pink Eloise-inspired suite and take afternoon tea Eloise-style in The Palm Court.

Address: Two East 55th Street At, 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022

This landmark Midtown hotel has long been synonymous with New York sophistication and glamour as well as unabashed fame and fortune. After mogul John Jacob Astor IV opened the architectural stunner in 1904 and met a famously tragic end with the sinking of the Titanic, the St. Regis continued to shine. Celebrities like Salvador Dali, Marlene Dietrich, and John Lennon roamed the hallways, many staying for long-term residencies. Fictional characters flourished too, including everyone¡¯s favorite spy, James Bond; author Ian Fleming placed the hotel at center stage in Live and Let Die.
King Cole Bar and the Maxfield Parrish painting by the same name generate ample star attraction as well. Be sure to have a Bloody Mary at the bar where the spicy cocktail is said to have originated.
