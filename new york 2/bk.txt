Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux¡ªthe visionary designers behind Central Park¡ªProspect Park offers Brooklynites a chance to get back in touch with nature.

200 Eastern Pkwy 
Brooklyn 
11238 

One of Kings County¡¯s preeminent cultural institutions, this 560,000-square-foot venue made history as the first American museum to exhibit African objects as artwork. In addition to the more than 4,000 items in the Egyptian holdings, museumgoers can scope pieces by masters such as C¨¦zanne, Monet and Degas, plus an entire center devoted to feminist art. (The venue is the permanent home of Judy Chicago¡¯s massive installation The Dinner Party.)

Olmsted

Address: 659 Vanderbilt Ave 
Brooklyn 
11238 

This Prospect Heights gem is worth the trip for the gorgeous garden out back alone (and the s¡¯mores served there). But then you would miss the full magic that chef Greg Baxtrom, an alum of Alinea and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, is creating in the kitchen. Each item of the eccectic menu is refined, yet taps into some soft of nostalgic memory, whether it be their kale crab rangoon or creamy frozen yogurt with lavender honey. While dinner in this cozy space is magical, their newly launched brunch service is just as noteworthy.


Sunday in Brooklyn
https://media.timeout.com/images/105284213/750/422/image.jpg

348 Wythe Avenue and South 2nd Street 
Brooklyn 
11249 

Contrary to their name, Sunday in Brooklyn is indeed open for brunch and dinner every day of the week. The rustic three-story space offers cozy vibes with warm wood interiors and an outdoor patio. While you've probably seen their malted pancakes with hazelnut-maple praline on Instagram (they¡¯re just as good as they look) from their brunch, chef Jaime Young is bringing the same innovation and attention to detail to dinner. Don't miss the pastrami black cod with sour cream, pickles and toasted sourdough or the fried togarashi chicken with fancy ranch.

Miss Ada
https://media.timeout.com/images/105316270/750/422/image.jpg

Address: 184 DeKalb Ave 
Brooklyn 
11205 
No, Miss Ada isn¡¯t the name of some chef¡¯s grade-school teacher. Rather, it¡¯s a playful twist on the phonetic pronunciation of misada, the Hebrew word for ¡°restaurant.¡± At this Fort Greene spot, Israeli-born chef Tomer Blechman (Bar Bolonat) combines his Latvian heritage with Mediterranean cooking. While you¡¯ll be tempted to fill up on the incredible pita and silky whipped ricotta with brown butter and sage, be sure to save room for their warm hummus with lamb shawarma, falafel with green tahini and harissa-drizzled brick chicken.
